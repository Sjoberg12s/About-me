# About-me
I love working with data-related stuff, whether with microcontrollers or programming different types of stuff.
I play floorball in my spare time which is one of my favorite hobbies outside of technology. I also love helping other
people with their problems, especially tech problems because it is fun to troubleshoot and discover the root cause of an issue.
I also enjoy configuring or using different types of electronic stuff such as sensors our speakers.

I have programmed in Java, C and C#  I have also picked up some SQL along the way, which includes the creation and
management of a database. Programs I have created includes a snake game for a microcontroller using C, Calculator in C# and a memory game using Java.
