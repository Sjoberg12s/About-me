# About-me
I love working with data-related stuff, whether with microcontrollers or programming different types of stuff.
I play floorball in my spare time which is one of my favorite hobbies outside of technology. I also love helping other
people with their problems, especially tech problems because it is fun to troubleshoot and discover the root cause of an issue.

I have programmed in Java, C and C# for over 4+ years and I have also picked up some SQL along the way, which includes the creation and
management of a database,
